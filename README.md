# Control Board Simulator

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or newer (npm included)

## Quick start

Change into the app workspace first:

```bash
cd app
npm install       # install dependencies
npm run dev       # start the dev server (defaults to http://localhost:5173)
```

The Manual Test panel only appears in development mode, so `npm run dev` is the go-to command for day-to-day work.

## Build & preview
```bash
npm run build     # produce a production bundle
npm run preview   # (optional) preview the build locally
```
